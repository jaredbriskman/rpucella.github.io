<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>In this homework, we're going to implement code to represent an Entity-Relationship (ER) model, and to instantiate such a model with actual data. Remember, the ER model is conceptual, so the focus is not particularly on usability, but rather, on expressiveness.</p>
<p>File <code>homework1.py</code> contains skeleton classes that you will fill out the implement an ER model. The main class is <code>ERModel</code>, with the following interface:</p>
<pre><code>class ERModel (object):

   def __init__ (self)
   # Instantiate an empty ER model.

   def entity_sets (self)
   # Return a list of all entity set names.

   def create_entity_set (self,name,attributes,attributes_key)
   # Create an entity set with a given &#39;name&#39; and described 
   # by a list of &#39;attributes&#39; and a sublist &#39;attributes_key&#39;
   # stating which attributes are used as a primary key for entities
   # in the set, and adds it to the model.

   def read_entity_set (self,name)
   # Return the entity set object with the given &#39;name&#39; in the model.

   def relationship_sets (self)
   # Return a list of all relationship set names.

   def create_relationship_set (self,name,roles,attributes=[])
   # Create a relationship set with a given &#39;name&#39; and described 
   # by a dictionary &#39;roles&#39; mapping role names to entity set names
   # and by a list of &#39;attributes&#39;, and adds it to the model.

   def read_relationship_set (self,name)
   # Return the relationship set object with the given &#39;name&#39; in the
   # model.</code></pre>
<p>As we saw, an ERModel is made up of entity sets and relationship sets. An ERModel is initially empty, and you can add entity sets via <code>create_entity_set</code> and relationship sets via <code>create_relationship_set</code>. Note that the entity and relationship sets you create are empty (they contain no entities or relationships -- those are added elsewhere). You can also get a specific entity set or relationship set from the ER model via <code>read_entity_set</code> and <code>read_relationship_set</code>. This is a restricted set of CRUD operations: you can only create and read entity and relationship sets. Methods <code>entity_sets</code> and <code>relationship_sets</code> will give you a list of the names of all the entity sets and of all the relationship sets in a model, respectively.</p>
<p><span style="color:blue;">Methods <code>create_entity_set</code> and <code>create_relationship_set</code> should raise an exception if an entity set or relationship set of the given name already exists, while <code>read_entity_set</code> and <code>read_relationship_set</code> should raise an exception if an entity set or relationship set of the given name does not exist.</span></p>
<p>When creating an entity set via <code>ERModel.create_entity_set</code>, the method will instantiate an object of <code>EntitySet</code> class, specifying the list of attributes describing the entities in the set, and the sublist of attributes used to construct a primary key for entitites in the set:</p>
<pre><code>class EntitySet (object):

   def __init__ (self,attributes,attributes_key)
   # Instantiate an entity set with entities described by a list
   # of &#39;attributes&#39; and a sublist &#39;attributes_key&#39; stating
   # which attributes are used as primary key for entities in
   # the set.

   def entity_keys (self)
   # Return the list of primary keys of the entities in the set.

   def create_entity (self,attributes)
   # Create an entity in the entity set from a dictionary &#39;attributes&#39;
   # mapping each attribute name of the entity set to a value.
   
   def read_entity (self,key)
   # Return the entity in the entity set with primary key given by
   # &#39;key&#39;.

   def delete_entity (self,key)
   # Delete the entity in the entity set with primary key given by
   # &#39;key&#39;.</code></pre>
<p>Again, <code>EntitySet</code> supports CRUD operations for creation, reading, and deleting entities in the entity set. (There is no update, but could be added.) Those operations are keyed by the primary keys of entities. The primary keys corresponding to entities and returned by <code>entity_keys</code> and used as arguments to <code>read_entity</code> and <code>delete_entity</code> are dictionaries mapping an attribute name which is part of the key (as specified in the creation of the entity set) to the value of that attribute in the entity. For instance, if an an entity set was created specifying attributes <code>[&quot;title&quot;,&quot;isbn&quot;,&quot;year&quot;,&quot;numberPages&quot;]</code> and a key specified by attributes <code>[&quot;isbn&quot;]</code>, then a possible primary key for an entity would be</p>
<pre><code>{
   &quot;isbn&quot;: &quot;0062255655&quot;
}</code></pre>
<p><span style="color:blue;">Methods <code>create_entity</code> should raise an exception if an entity with the same primary key already exists in the entity set, while <code>read_entity</code> and <code>delete_entity</code> should raise an exception if an entity with the given primary key does not exist in the entity set.</span></p>
<p>When creating an entity via <code>EntitySet.create_entity</code>, the method will instantiate an object of <code>Entity</code> class, specifying a dictionary mappin every attribute name to a value, and also providing the list of attributes used to construct the primary key of the entity.</p>
<pre><code>class Entity (object):

    def __init__ (self,attributes,attributes_key)
    # Instantiate an entity from a dictionary &#39;attributes&#39; mapping
    # every attribute name to a value, and a list &#39;attributes_key&#39;
    # listing the attributes used to construct the primnary key of
    # the entity.

    def attribute (self,name)
    # Return the value of attribute &#39;name&#39; in the entity.

    def primary_key (self)
    # Return the primary key (as a dictionary) for the entity.</code></pre>
<p><span style="color: blue;">Here's a sample interaction:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; t = ERModel()

&gt;&gt;&gt; t.create_entity_set(&quot;Test&quot;,[&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;],[&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;])

&gt;&gt;&gt; t.read_entity_set(&quot;Test&quot;).create_entity({&quot;a&quot;:100,&quot;b&quot;:200,&quot;c&quot;:300})

&gt;&gt;&gt; t.read_entity_set(&quot;Test&quot;).read_entity({&quot;a&quot;:100,&quot;b&quot;:200}).attribute(&quot;a&quot;)
100

&gt;&gt;&gt; t.read_entity_set(&quot;Test&quot;).read_entity({&quot;a&quot;:100,&quot;b&quot;:200}).attribute(&quot;b&quot;)
200

&gt;&gt;&gt; t.read_entity_set(&quot;Test&quot;).read_entity({&quot;a&quot;:100,&quot;b&quot;:200}).attribute(&quot;c&quot;)
300

&gt;&gt;&gt; t.read_entity_set(&quot;Test&quot;).read_entity({&quot;a&quot;:100,&quot;b&quot;:200}).primary_key()
{&#39;a&#39;: 100, &#39;b&#39;: 200}

&gt;&gt;&gt; print(t.read_entity_set(&quot;Test&quot;).read_entity({&quot;a&quot;:100,&quot;b&quot;:200}))
[a=100|b=200|c=300]</code></pre>

<p>Relationship sets (and relationships) are similar to entity sets (and entities). When creating a relationship set via <code>ERModel.create_relationship_set</code>, the method will instantiate an object of <code>RelationshipSet</code> class, specifying the entity set name corresponding to each role, and a list of attributes for the relationships in the set:</p>
<pre><code>class RelationshipSet (object):

   def __init__ (self,roles,attributes)
   # Instantiate a relationship set with relationships described
   # by a dictionary &#39;roles&#39; from role names to entity set objects
   # associated with each role, and a list of attributes for the
   # relationships.
    
   def relationship_keys (self)
   # Return the primary keys of the relationships in the
   # relationship set.

   def create_relationship (self,role_keys,attributes={})
   # Create a new relationship in the relationship set from
   # a dictionary &#39;role_keys&#39; mapping every role in the
   # relationship to the primary key of an entity participating
   # in the relationship, and an (optional) dictionary &#39;attributes&#39;
   # associated a value with every attribute of the relationship.

   def read_relationship (self,pkey)
   # Return the relationship in the relationship set with primary
   # key given by &#39;pkey&#39;.

   def delete_relationship (self,pkey)
   # Delete the relationship in the relationship set with primary
   # key given by &#39;pkey&#39;.</code></pre>
<p>Again, <code>RelationshipSet</code> supports CRUD operations for creation, reading, and deleting relationships in the relationship set. (There is no update, but could be added.) Those operations are keyed by the primary keys of relationships. The primary key of a relationship is a dictionary mapping each role to the primary key of the entity associated with that role. For example, if a relationship associates entities <code>E1</code>, <code>E2</code>, <code>E3</code> with roles <code>&quot;r1&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;r2&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;r3&quot;</code> and the primary keys of <code>E1</code>, <code>E2</code>, <code>E3</code> are given by dictionaries <code>K1</code>, <code>K2</code>, <code>K3</code>, then the primary key of the relationship is the dictionary</p>
<pre><code>{
  &quot;r1&quot;: K1,
  &quot;r2&quot;: K2,
  &quot;r3&quot;: K3
}</code></pre>
<p><span style="color:blue;">Methods <code>create_relationship</code> should raise an exception if a relationship with the same primary key already exists in the relationship set, while <code>read_relationship</code> and <code>delete_relationship</code> should raise an exception if a relationship with the given primary key does not exist in the relationship set.</span></p>
<p>When creating a relationship via <code>RelationshipSet.create_relationship</code>, the method will instantiate an object of <code>Relationship</code> class, specifying a dictionary mapping every role name to the primary key of the entity associated with that role for the relationship being constructed, and a dictionary mapping every attribute name to the value of that attribute for the relationship between constructued:</p>
<pre><code>class Relationship (object):

   def __init__ (self,role_keys,attributes)
   # Instantiate a relationship by providing a dictionary
   # &#39;role_keys&#39; mapping every role name to the primary key of the
   # entity associated with that role, and a dictionary
   # &#39;attributes&#39; mapping every attribute name to a value.

   def attribute (self,name)
   # Return the value of attribute &#39;name&#39; in the relationship.
        
   def role_key (self,role)
   # Return the primary key of the entity associate with &#39;role&#39; name.
   
   def primary_key (self)
   # Return the primary key of the relationship, namely a
   # dictionary mapping every role name to the primary key of the
   # entity associated with that role.</code></pre>

<p><span style="color:blue;">The entity set object returned by <code>ERModel.read_entity_set</code> should be the same object as stored in the <code>ERModel</code> instance, and similarly for the relationship set object returned by <code>ERModel.read_relationship_set</code>. In other words, the entity set or relationship set object is <em>shared</em>. This means, for example, when we add an entity to the entity set returned by <code>ERModel.read_entity_set</code>, we also are modifying the entity set inside the <code>ERModel</code> instance. There is some convenience with this approach, and also some disadvantages. Feel free to think about the pros and cons. The sample code I provided you does rely on this sharing, though.</span></p>

<h2>Question 3 (for teams of 3 only)</h2>
<p>Recall that a cardinality constraint on a relationship set R describes in how many relationships in R an entity may participate. We'll focus exclusively on binary relationship sets, that is, relationship sets that associate entities in two entity sets.</p>
<p>Let R be a relationship set associating entities in A with entities in B. A many-to-many cardinality constraint (M:M) indicates that entities in A can be in 0 or more relationships with an entity in B, and vice versa. A one-to-many cardinality constraint (1:M) indicates that entities in A can be in at most one relationship with an entity in B, but entities in B can be in 0 or more relationships with an entity in A. Many-to-one (M:1) and one-to-one (1:1) were described in the notes.</p>
<p>In this question, you'll extend relationship sets with <strong>cardinality constraints</strong>. Again, we'll only do that for binary relationship sets, that is, relationship sets that have exactly two roles. (You can ignore cardinality constraints if the relationship set is not binary.) Moreover, we'll want to do that in a way that <em>does not</em> break backward compatibility with the code above. In other word, the code you wrote before this question should work perfectly well even after you implement this question.</p>
<p>First, extend the <code>RelationshipSet</code> class so that its <code>__init__</code> constructor takes an extra <em>optional</em> argument <code>cardinality</code> which represents a cardinality constraint on the relationship set. There are many equivalent ways we can express cardinality constraints. We'll take an easy one: we'll pass a list of roles, those roles that have a <strong>1</strong> cardinality constraint, that is, those roles whose entities are required to be in at most one relationship with an entity in the other role.</p>
<p>For example, if a relationship set has two roles <code>role_a</code> and <code>role_b</code> and the cardinality constraint we want to impose is that entities in <code>role_a</code> participate in at most one relationship with entities in <code>role_b</code> but no such restriction the other way (a 1:M constraint), we represent this cardinality constraint with the list <code>[&quot;role_a&quot;]</code>. If it's entities in <code>role_b</code> that we want restricted to at most one relationship with entities in <code>role_a</code> but no such restriction on entities in <code>role_a</code> (a M:1 constraint), we represent this cardinality constraint with the list <code>[&quot;role_b&quot;]</code>. And if we want both entities in <code>role_a</code> to be restricted to at most one relationship with entities in <code>role_b</code> and also entities in <code>role_b</code> to be restrictedd to at most one relationship with entities in <code>role_a</code> (a 1:1 constraint), we represent this cardinality constraint with the list <code>[&quot;role_a&quot;,&quot;role_b&quot;]</code>. An M:M relationship (the default!) is therefore represented by the list <code>[]</code>.</p>
<p>Enforce the cardinality constraint in the <code>create_relationship</code> method of <code>RelationshipSet</code>: if the method is asked to create a relationship that violates the constraint, then throw an exception with a message indicating which cardinality constraint has been violated.</p>
<p>Finally, modify method <code>create_relationship_set</code> of class <code>ERModel</code> to take an <em>optional</em> argument <code>cardinality</code> that represents a cardinality constraint to impose on the relationship set created, and creates the relationship set with the specified cardinality constraint (if any).</p>
