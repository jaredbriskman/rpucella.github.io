    <p>This course explores the notion of computation. We're going to develop
    formal tools for defining what we mean by computation, through
    various forms of automata. We'll develop ways to talk about the
    efficiency of computations, by quantifying their time
    complexity. We will examine alternative models of
    computations, and see how they correspond to different
    programming paradigms: functional programming, logic programming,
    and object-oriented programming. We will end with a discussion of
    basic data structures and algorithms.

	    will let you read through them. Thankfully, that class
	    was a bit of a parenthesis, since I did not

	    lectures. So have a read, and let us know if you have any
	    questions. Rest assured our Ninjas know this stuff down
	    cold. <br><br>
	     I will fold part of what
	  would have been the homework this week into the next, which

      <h3>Course Information</h3>

      <p><b>Prerequisites:</b> We're part of a pilot that removes Discrete Mathematics as a prerequisite for FoCS. This means that there are no prerequisites, but prior experience programming will be helpful, as will previous exposure to set-theoretic concepts.</p>

      <p><b>Instructor:</b> <a href="http://www.rpucella.net">Riccardo Pucella</a> (&#x72;&#x69;&#x63;&#x63;&#x61;&#x72;&#x64;&#x6F;&#x2E;&#x70;&#x75;&#x63;&#x65;&#x6C;&#x6C;&#x61;&#x40;&#x6F;&#x6C;&#x69;&#x6E;&#x2E;&#x65;&#x64;&#x75;)</p>

      <!-- <p><b>Office hours:</b> Thu 15:00-16:00 / MH 353</p> -->

      <p><b>Textbooks:</b> There is no required textbook for the course. We will be working off notes and online references.</p>

      <p>
	There are several excellent books on Theory of Computation
      (the first part of the course), but they are a bit expensive considering that we will 
	be covering only a small part of their content. If you need extra assistance, though, any of these books would be useful:
      <ul>
	<li>Sisper, <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Theory-Computation-Michael-Sipser/dp/1133187811">Introduction to the Theory of Computation</a></i></li>
	<li>Hopcroft, Motwani, Ullman, <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Automata-Theory-Languages-Computation/dp/0321455363">Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation</a></i></li>
      </ul>
      The library has those two books on reserve.
      </p>

      <p>
      An inexpensive and still reasonable book is the following, which uses Ruby instead of OCaml:
      <ul>
	<li>Stuart, <i><a href="http://computationbook.com">Understanding Computation</a></i></li>
      </ul>
      </p>
    
      <p><b>Programming:</b> All programming in this course will be done
      using the programming
      language <a href="https://ocaml.org/">OCaml</a>. The OCaml
      interpreter can be downloaded from the web site, and
	supports installations on most common systems. Here are a couple of reasonable books on OCaml that you might
      want to get your hands on if you prefer learning your
      programming language from a book instead of the web:</p>
      
      <ul>
	<li>Hickey, <i><a href="http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs134/cs134b/book.pdf">Introduction
	      to Objective Caml</a></i> (PDF)</li>
	<li>Downey, Monje, <i><a href="http://greenteapress.com/thinkocaml/">Think
	  OCaml</a></i></li>
	<li>Minsky, Madhavapeddy, Hickey, <i><a href="https://realworldocaml.org/">Real World
	  OCaml</a></i></li>
      </ul>

      <p>Some online resources:</p>
      <ul>

	<li><a href="http://www.csc.villanova.edu/~dmatusze/resources/ocaml/ocaml.html"><i>A
	      Concise Introduction to Objective Caml</i></a> &mdash;
	  written for OCaml v3; one difference is that you
	  should write <tt>#use "file.ml";;</tt> to load a
	  file of definitions</li>

	<li>Some information on
	  the <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/toplevel.html#sec256">commands
	    you can use in the OCaml shell</a>, which can be
	  useful</li>

	<li>The <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/index.html">official
	    OCaml manual</a></li>

	<li>There are no official IDEs for OCaml, but many
	  people swear
	  by <a href="https://github.com/diml/utop"><i>utop</i></a>,
	  which is an OCaml shell replacement. There's also
	  <a href="http://camelia.sourceforge.net/"><i>Camelia</i></a>,
	  but I've never used it. There is
	  an <a href="http://www.algo-prog.info/ocaide/">Eclipse
	    plug-in</a> for OCaml.
	</li>
      </ul>
      


      <p><b>Grading:</b> The final grade is based on weekly homework (60%)
      and two exams (20% each). The exact weighting is subject to change. 
	All work will be done
      individually. Late homeworks will be penalized (10% per 24 hours)
      and no homework will be accepted after its solution has been
      discussed in class.

      <p><b>Ninjas:</b> We have three ninjas for the class: Sarah Walters (<tt>sarah.walters</tt>), Austin Greene (<tt>austin.greene</tt>), and Deniz Celik (<tt>deniz.celik</tt>). All emails at <tt>students.olin.edu</tt>.</p>

      <p><b>Office hours:</b>
	<table class="office-hours">
	  <tr><td>Monday</td><td>19:00 - 21:00</td><td>Austin in EH1</td></tr>
	  <tr><td>Tuesday</td><td>18:00 - 20:00</td><td>Deniz in EH1</td></tr>
