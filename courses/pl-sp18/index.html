    <p>This course is an introduction to the theory, design, and
    implementation of programming languages. Topics covered may
    include: semantics of programming languages, types, higher-order
    functions and lambda calculus, objects, laziness, continuations,
    monads, objects, and concurrency. Class work revolves around the
    implementation of interpreters for a variety of small programming
    languages.</p>

      <p>Textbook: We don't have a textbook. There is nothing out
      there that captures quite what I want to do in this course. I
      will find readings for us to supplement the lectures. 

      If you're looking for reference books that cover some of the
     topics we'll cover, the following might help:
      <ul>
	<li>
         <i><a href="http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs173/2012/book/">Programming
	Languages: Application and Interpretation</a></i> by Shriram Krishnamurthy. This is the
	closest book in spirit to what I want to cover in the
	course. It is freely available online. It uses Racket, a
	dialect of Scheme. Definitely worth a read.</li>
      </ul>

      <!--
	<li>Glynn
	Winskell, <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Formal-Semantics-Programming-Languages-Winskel/dp/0262731037">Formal
	Semantics of Programming Languages</a></i>. This book specifically
	covers formal semantics, and not implementation, so it looks pretty remove from what we're taThere are
	many excellent textbooks on semantics that have been
	published in the last few years. This one is a bit older, but
	it's a classic, and you should be able to find good used
	copies.</li> -->
	
      <p>Programming: All programming in the course will be done in
	<a href="https://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a> (version 2.12, though that shouldn't matter an awful lot).
	I will not expect you to know how to program in Scala, but you should have good working knowledge of Python, especially its object model. . We'll pick up Scala proper as we go along. A good reference manual is:

      <ul>
	<li><i><a href="https://booksites.artima.com/programming_in_scala_3ed">Programming in Scala</a> 3rd edition</i> by Martin Odersky, Lex Spoon, and Bill Venners. The first edition is <a href="http://www.artima.com/pins1ed/">available online</a>, if you want to check it out. (The core language hasn't changed that much, but I'm not sure how much the first edition carries over when you get to more advanced topics.)</li>
      </ul>

      You can get Scala
      from the <a href="https://www.scala-lang.org/download/">official download page</a>. Note that
      if you install Scala on Windows, you'll probably want to install
      the Scala binaries instead of using <tt>sbt</tt> so that you
      have easy access to the interactive compiler. (The Scala build
      tool <tt>sbt</tt> is great, but pretty much overkill for what
      we're going to do, at least at first.) Scala can be installed
      from Homebrew on Mac OS X. The appropriate .tgz is available for
      Linux</p>

      <p>Grading: The final grade is based on weekly homeworks for the
      first five weeks (40%), biweekly homeworks for the following four
      weeks (30%), and a final project (30%). All work to be done in
      teams of two. Late homeworks will be penalized (10% per 24 hours)
      and no homework will be accepted after its solution has been
	discussed in class.</p>

		  <p>If you already know Java, <a href="http://docs.scala-lang.org/tutorials/scala-for-java-programmers.html"><i>A Scala Tutorial for Java Programmers</i></a> might be useful for you.</p>

		  <p>The class hierarchy we will develop for the abstract representation of our languages uses an abstract base class (in the code above, <tt>Exp</tt>). If you've never worked with abstract base classes, <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/abstract.html">you can find a description here</a> for Java &mdash; the discussion applies to Scala in the same way. Abstract classes don't really make sense in Python, so you would not have encountered them there. (Why?)</p>

You should be able to access it by writing <tt>import scala.util.parsing.combinator._</tt> in your scala code. For an in-depth example that uses parser combinators, have a look at <a href="http://enear.github.io/2016/03/31/parser-combinators/">this</a>, but note that it uses concepts from Scala we have not introduced yet.</p>

	    <p>If you're interested in some of the theory underlying parser combinators, a good starting point is Graham Hutton's <a href="http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/parsing.pdf"><i>Higher-Order Functions for Parsing</i></a> tutorial.</p>

	  <div class="lect">
	    <p><a href="homework4.html">Homework 4</a>, due next Monday.</p>
	    <p>The first question of the homework involves front-end
	      transformations. Basically, we can add surface syntax
	      expressions that does not require an associated abstract
	      representation, if we transform what is expressed in the
	      surface syntax into simpler expressions for which we do
	      have abstract representations.  How do those kind of
	      transformations relate to syntax extensions (or macros)
	      as implemented
	      by <a href="https://www.cs.indiana.edu/scheme-repository/R4RS/r4rs_12.html">Scheme</a>
	      or
	      by <a href="https://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/book/macros.html">Rust</a>?
	      The short answer: those kind of syntax extensions
	      are <i>exactly</i> the sort of transformations that we
	      can implement by hacking the parser in the way I
	      described. What those language do is that they allow
	      transformations to be expressed <i>within the
	      language</i>, and their parser can look up those
	      transformations while parsing, instead of requiring the
	      transformations to be hard-wired into the parser. Same
	      process, slightly more flexible approach. (There's a
	      cost to that approach: the parser needs to be more
	      complex because it needs to look up applicable
	      transformations at suitable points. It might be a very nice project to figure out ways of doing just that.)

	    <p>Wikipedia's entry on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system">type systems</a> is reasonable.</p>
	    <p>At the end of lecture, I mentioned the problem of
	    giving a reasonable type to reference cells. The sample
	    code types function <tt>ref</tt> as <tt>(-> ((int)) (ref
	    int))</tt>, and therefore will only work to create integer
	    reference cells. There is no way, say, to create a Boolean
	    referenece cells. A more general type for reference cells
	    uses <i>type variables</i> to give
	    a <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_programming">generic
	    type</a></i> to <tt>ref</tt>, along the lines of <tt>(->
  ((a)) (ref a))</tt>. The modifications necessary to the type
checker are not extensive, except for the case of <tt>ECall</tt>,
which
	    requires <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unification_(computer_science)">unification</a>
	    in order to figure out the types to assign to the type
	    variables to obtain the result type of the call. (I may
	    provide some sample code in the future for this, or it can
	    be a final project.) Type systems with generics are known
	    as polymorphic type systems.
	    </p>

<p>
  Adding generics  are one way to extend
  type systems to type more expressions while still
  maintaining safety. More advanced type systems
  using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_type">dependent
    types</a> are even more expressive, and also more complex

	    <p>The <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/">ACL2</a> theorem prover (and its easier-to-use cousin <a href="http://acl2s.ccs.neu.edu/acl2s/doc/">ACL2 Sedan</a>
		which I used in class), and the code for <a href="./isort.lisp">proving the
		correcteness of insertion sort</a>.</p>
	    <p>Two theorem provers based on type theory: <a href="https://coq.inria.fr/">Coq</a> and <a href="http://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda">Agda</a>.</p>
	    <p>A fantastic <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/sf/current/index.html">online textbook on using Coq</a> for proving theorems, including theorems about interpreters!</p>
