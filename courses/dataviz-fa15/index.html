      <p>Interactive data visualization sits at the intersection of graphic design and programming. 
         The ideal visualization needs to be easy to understand and aesthetically pleasing, but also 
         interactively navigable, permit different views of the data, and be responsive no matter the 
         amount of data being displayed. The course will focus on the technological aspects of data 
         visualization, from databases and data structures and algorithms to process data, to 
         technologies for interactive visualization such as Javascript/D3.  Course work will be 
         project-driven, based on existing available large data sets. By the end of the course, 
         we should be able to construct visualizations such as 
         <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/interactives/world-cup/">2014 World Cup Predictions</a>  or  
         <a href="http://ri.id.au/closethegap">Close the Gap</a>.</p>

      <h3>Course Info</h3>


      <p>Prerequisites: ENGR 2510 (Software Design)</p>

      <p>Instructor: <a href="http://www.rpucella.net">Riccardo Pucella</a> (<a id="send_email" href="#">send email</a>)</p>

      <p>Office hours: Mon 16:00-18:00 / MH 353</p>

      <p>We will use two books:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>Scott Murray, <i><a href="http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000345">Interactive Data Visualization for the Web</a></i></li>
	<li>Douglas
	Crockford, <i><a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596517748.do">JavaScript:
	The Good Parts</a></i></li>
      </ul>
	
      <p>These books are mostly for reference, but they are good
      references. They provide a narrative that is otherwise lost when
      you look up information online. Murray's book covers D3, the main
      JavaScript library we will use to develop our visualizations. Crockford's book
      covers the non-objectionable parts of the JavaScript
      language, and gives a good sense of the coding style that
      I'll be using.</p>

      <p>Grading: The grade in this course is based on project work: project 1 (10%), projects 2-5 (15% each), 
      final project (30%). Projects are to be completed in teams of three. Those teams will be determined by the instructor (in a combination of random
      selection and cycling) and will be different for each project. Late projects will be penalized. Email the instructor for 
      detail on said penalties.  </p>

      <!-- <p>Late work policy: Homeworks are due at the beginning of lecture on the due date. The penalty for late homeworks is 10% per 24 hours. Note that I will usually discuss the homework that has been submitted on the first lecture past the due date. (Since homeworks are due on Thursdays, that would then usually be the following Monday.) Once I've done that, I will no longer be able to accept late submissions.</p> -->

      <ul class="lectures">
	<li><p><b>PROJECT 1: Warm-up (and calibration)</b></p>
	  <div class="lect">

	    <p>Due date: <i>Mon Sep 21 at noon</i></p>

	    <p>Each of the questions below ask you to draw something in a canvas. I've provided you with a <a href="project1.html">skeleton HTML file</a> that holds three canvases. (You'll want to right-click and <i>save as</i>.) The HTML file calls a function <tt>run()</tt> upon loading. You should put calls to your drawing functions in that function.</p>

<ol>

<li>(SCENERY)

<p>Code a function <tt>drawScenery()</tt> that draws a scenery (landscape, cityscape, etc) in the canvas with ID <tt>canvas-q1</tt>. Don't use images. Construct everything using the basic drawing primitives. Chances are it'll look like something out of a kindergarden class. That's perfectly okay. In fact, even good. You should try to be original. I did not even try.</p>

<img src="./house1.png" height="200" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"></img>
<p style="margin-top: 30px;">"This is my drawing of a house. There are many like it, but this one is mine." (Riccardo, 6 y.o., Elizabeth-Turgeon School)</p>
<p style="clear:both;">Make sure you call <tt>drawScenery()</tt> from <tt>run()</tt>.
</li>

<li>(TURTLE GRAPHICS)
<p>
  Paths in a canvas are defined using lines and arcs given in term of canvas coordinates. An alternate approach is to define a path by a sequence of "moves": starting at a given position pointing in a given direction, move forward 100 units, turn left 45 degrees, then forward 100 units, etc. This approach to drawing is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics">turtle graphics</a>.</p>

  <p>We are going to represent the sequence of moves using an array. I will describe it using examples. The following array represents moving forward 100 units: <tt>["f",100]</tt>. The following array represents moving forward 100 units, turning right 45 degrees, moving forward 60 units, turning left 45 degrees, then moving forward 100 units: <tt>["f",100,"r",45,"f",60,"l",45,"f",100]</tt>. Makes sense?</p>

  <p>Just for kicks, let's add another feature. A move <tt>pu</tt> will "lift the pen off the page" so that subsequent moves are still considered but they are not actually drawn. A move <tt>pd</tt> will "put the pen back on the page" so that subsequent moves now draw again.</p>

  <p>Code a function <tt>draw(ctxt,x,y,moves)</tt> that takes a context <tt>ctxt</tt> on a canvas, an initial position (<tt>x</tt>,<tt>y</tt>) in the canvas, and a sequences of <tt>moves</tt> as above, and draws the corresponding path in the canvas. </p>

  <p>By default, the initial direction should be the unit vector of the x-axis (i.e., facing east if the canvas was a map in the standard orientation). The pen is initially down.</p>

  <p>The following should draw the letter H in a context <tt>ctxt</tt> at position (100,100):</p>
<pre>
    draw(ctxt,100,100,["f",40,
		       "r",90,
		       "f",40,
		       "l",90,
		       "f",20,
		       "l",90,
		       "f",40,
		       "r",90,
		       "f",40,
		       "r",90,
		       "f",100,
		       "r",90,
		       "f",40,
		       "r",90,
		       "f",40,
		       "l",90,
		       "f",20,
		       "l",90,
		       "f",40,
		       "r",90,
		       "f",40,
		       "r",90,
		       "f",100]);
</pre>
  <p>Code a function that draws something interesting in the canvas with ID <tt>canvas-q2</tt> using your <tt>draw()</tt> function. You should try a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_curve">space-filling curve</a> or a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_snowflake">Koch snowflake</a>. Make sure you call your function from <tt>run()</tt></p>
  
  <p>You'll want to review your basic trigonometry. Sine and cosine functions are available in JavaScript as <tt>Math.sin()</tt> and <tt>Math.cos()</tt>.
  They expect angles in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian">radians</a>, which range from 0 to <tt>Math.PI*2</tt>. The angles
  in the sequence of moves should be in degrees.</p>
</li>

<li>(SIMPLE ANIMATION)

  <p>Code a function <tt>drawAnimScenery()</tt> that draws the scenery you designed in Question 1 in canvas with ID <tt>canvas-q3</tt> and animates in an interesting way.</p>

  <img src="./house2.gif" height="200" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"></img>
  <p>How do you do animation? Exactly as you would expect: an animation is a movie, and a movie is just a sequence of pictures (frames) shown at regular intervals. So the trick is to repeatedly draw into the canvas, one frame at a time, erasing the canvas between each frame.</p>

  <p> On the right is an animation I constructed from my scenery above. It's actually an animated GIF because I can't well put in my canvas animation code right here, can I? (Unfortunately, the animated GIF coder is buggy, and messes up colors. Thus the weird effects in the cloud and the sun. Ignore that. Canvas animation will be fine.)</p>

  <p>There's a bit of a subtlety in doing animation in the browser: you can't just write a for-loop and draw repeatedly in the canvas within that for-loop. Most browsers only render the canvas when control <i>returns</i> from JavaScript back to the browser. So if you animate in a for-loop, all you'll see is the last frame you ended up drawing, assuming your for-loop terminates. (Remember when I said in class that the inverted program structure forced on you by the browser has consequences? This is one of those.) So what you want to do is have the <i>browser</i> control the looping. Have a look at <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowTimers/setInterval">setInterval()</a> or <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame">requestAnimationFrame()</a>, that should give you some hint. If you're stuck, get in touch with me.</p>

<p style="clear:both;">Make sure you call <tt>drawAnimScenery()</tt> from <tt>run()</tt>.
